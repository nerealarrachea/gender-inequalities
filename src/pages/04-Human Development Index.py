I already had the correlation of GII with health, economics and education. I wanted to do an extra one to see its relationship
with politics, so I did the next scatterplot to show the correlation between the share of seats in parliament that women occupy 
and GII. Something really interesting we can see, is that Rwanda is the top country with more women on the pairlament, this is due 
to the change on demographics the country had after a genocide that took place in 1994. (you can learn more about it here:
